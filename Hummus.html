    <p><em>Hummus</em> is a delicious spread or dip made from chickpeas, tahini, lemon and spices. It is commonly
        eaten in the <strong>Middle East and the Mediteranian.</strong> Here in the United State, you can find 
        store-brought version at the grocery store, but we think you should skip those and <q>make your own.</q>Let me show you how!</p>

<dt>Hummus Description:</dt>
<dd>
    Hummus, also spelled hommus or houmous, is a dip of Arab origin, spread, or savory dish made from cooked, mashed chickpeas blended with tahini (<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Tahina.JPG/250px-Tahina.JPG" width="100">), 
    lemon juice (<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.FemnQ0uM63kZ5-ifugE3dwHaE8?w=250&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" width="100">) and garlic (<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.BXEewCDNwm-M6It9WhhkUAHaE7?w=298&h=199&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" width="100">). 
    The standard garnish in the Middle East includes olive oil, a few whole chickpeas, parsley, and paprika. Popular in Middle Eastern cuisine, it is usually eaten as a dip, with pita bread. In the West, it is now produced industrially, and is often served as a snack or appetizer with crackers.
